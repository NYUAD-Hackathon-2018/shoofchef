-Description : 
Hummus is a Levantine Arab dip or spread that is made from chickpeas (also known as garbanzo beans) 
that have been cooked and mashed, then blended with tahini (a paste made from sesame seeds), olive oil, lemon juice, garlic and salt.
-Story : 
Many regions around the world claim to be the place where hummus originated. The fact is, that because hummus has been around for so long, and in so many different variations, the exact origin has been lost in antiquity. Several cuisine-related sources speak of a folklore tale in which hummus is described as one of the oldest known prepared foods. 
Others speak of a legend that hummus was first prepared in the 12th century by Saladin, however this claim is highly disputed.
