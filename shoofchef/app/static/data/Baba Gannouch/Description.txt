-Story : 
Baba Ghanoush is an eggplant dish that originated in Levant cuisine, frequently used for dipping. 
It is served mostly as an appetizer. The dish contains mainly olive oil and eggplant. Some cultures add in tahini, garlic, and pomegranate 
concentrate or lemon juice to add depth of flavor. In the Turkish culture, it is called both baba ghanoush and patlican salatasi,
which means eggplant salad. Most of the time it is either boiled or broiled until it is soft and then mashed with additional flavors
and olive oil. Many cultures serve the mashed mixture with rice, pitas or another type of bread native to their nation.
Baba Ghanoush is eaten in many Middle Eastern countries such as Syria, Lebanon and extending as far as the territorial reach of
the Ottoman empire. But Baba Ghanoush also is big in Brazil and West India. Romanians and Greeks also consume the appetizer. 
Other countries that include this food in their diets are Punjab, West India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Israel.
Many American restaurants do include baba ghanoush on their menus with a modern spin on it. You will see Baba Ghanoush on the menu of
